- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Hyun Lim. I am a staff scientist at Los Alamos National Laboratry
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in all aspect of computational physics. My reserach interests are including the interface of gravitational phyaiscs and astrophysics, scalable linear solver, preconditioner for hyperbolic PDE, and differentiable scheme for hydrodynamics. I am activley involving multiple code projects both in Eulerian and Lagrangian frameworks
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning managemant based on statistical learning and LSAT for my JD+MBA route! (not sure I can finish this but this is my new challenege)
- ðŸ“« How to reach me : Send me an email to hylim1988@gmail.com or hyunlim@lanl.gov. But note that if you have found the ultimate theory of everything, fixing the Einstein's theory of relativity, a way to build perpetual motion machine, or any other similar things, I'm very happy for you, but I really don't care to hear about it
