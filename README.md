- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Hyun Lim. I am a staff scientist at Los Alamos National Laboratry
Iâ€™m interested in all aspects of computational physics. My research interests are including the interface of gravitational physics and astrophysics, scalable linear solver, preconditioner for hyperbolic PDE, and differentiable scheme for hydrodynamics. I am actively involving multiple code projects both in Eulerian and Lagrangian frameworks. You can find my open source projects in this github but I also contribute to private sectors. I am trained as a theoretical physicists/mathematician (for my Ph.D). My previous works are including Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton-Axion theory, characteristics in PDE, higher dimensional BHs, etc. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning management based on statistical learning and LSAT for my JD+MBA route! (not sure I can finish this but this is my new challenege). Generous funding is supporting me to pursue this direction at Kellogg School of Management. 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me : Send me an email to hylim1988@gmail.com or hyunlim@lanl.gov. But note that if you have found the ultimate theory of everything, fixing the Einstein's theory of relativity, a way to build perpetual motion machine, or any other similar things, I'm very happy for you, but I really don't care to hear about it
